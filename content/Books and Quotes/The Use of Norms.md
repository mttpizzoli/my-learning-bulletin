Animals and plants don't have a limit on what they can do. They can do whatever to survive an thrive without any constraints.

While reading this book, with the word norm, I didn't only focus on written laws but also unwritten rules.

If you are in a bathroom queue and an invalid child comes behind you, even though you are not forced, you let him go first. That's the best thing you can do. I don't think there is a specific rule stating this, but I believe that 99% of people would do so.

Norms work among humans to contrast excessive competition. Redwoods do compete without norms, meaning that they really push the limit of a tree's height, while humans don't.

Humans use to set limits on what they can do for the best of society, not for individuals.
