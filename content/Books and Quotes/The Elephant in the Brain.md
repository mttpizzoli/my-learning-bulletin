I love this book by [[Kevin Simler]] and [[Robin Hanson]].

As I started to write this note, I haven't finished it yet, as there are a lot of concepts worth pondering. I am not sure I'll be able to do a complete summary of the book itself, but at least I'd like to expand on some concepts that I find especially interesting.

- [[Competitive Altruism]]
- [[Parable of the Redwoods]]
- [[The Use of Norms]]
