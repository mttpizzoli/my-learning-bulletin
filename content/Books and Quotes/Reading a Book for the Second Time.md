I was pondering the idea of reading a book for the second time, and I ended up reading this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pmsnlp/reading_a_book_twice_why_do_some_people_do_it/).

The post question is straightforward, but what really caught me is one of the most upvoted answers.

Quoting.

> [!quote]
> No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man. *[[Heraclitus]],*

I don't think there is much to add to this sentence, at least in this context.

Reflect on this: you are not the same individual you were a year ago or even a month ago. Our experiences, interactions, and, yes, even the books we read all contribute to our evolution as human beings. This is the essence of Heraclitus' quote, encapsulating the idea that change is constant and integral to our personal growth.

The quote also suggests that we are in a constant state of flux, just like the river, and that every time we revisit a situation or experience, we do so with a new perspective and understanding, much like stepping into a different river.

*This continuous evolution happens regardless of whether you actively pursue personal education and development.*

Starting a new job role teaches you new skills while maintaining your previous knowledge. This is also true if you change the town or even the house you live in. To some extent, even if you choose to buy your first car, you end up dealing with the buying-a-car procedure. Somehow, these are experiences that really shape who you are.

You might find that some once insignificant sentences are now carrying profound meaning. You might notice some details that were hidden from you by your inexperience. This shift is neither good nor bad. It simply reflects your growth.

I would also add that reading a book is an immersive activity. It requires a considerable amount of time to appreciate it fully. Unlike a movie that can be fully watched in hours, a book requires a deeper level of engagement.

Back in high school, I used to devour novels, often by renowned authors, all recommended by my literature teacher. Yet, I found myself struggling to grasp their deeper meanings. The historical context and the author's critiques often eluded me. Coupled with the reality that I was probably not the most attentive student, I realized I was comprehending less than a fraction of what I was supposed to.

This suggests that reading a book subtly influences one's life, even if one isn't consciously aware of it.

This whole experience is the secondary book that a reread could open.
