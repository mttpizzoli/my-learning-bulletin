## The *Show, Don't Tell* Paradigm

Picture yourself entering a writing class. I would not be surprised if you saw a big billboard behind the teacher's desk that proclaims, perhaps in bold typewriter font: *Show, Don't Tell*.

This phrase is a cornerstone of effective writing, but what exactly does it mean?"

Well, giving a proper definition is challenging.

However, suppose you find yourself immersed in a description and can perceive the scene and emotion the writer is showing. Imagine reading a novel where the scent of rain on asphalt, the glow of streetlights flickering in the fog, and the distant hum of city life envelop you. In that case, that's a writer showing you the world they've created.

Conversely, a shopping list simply states a bunch of items would never catch your attention. *He entered the grocery store and took out the shopping list, which states bread, milk, and mayonnaise (vegan)*. This piece only informs you. See the difference?

## Some Examples

A clear example that illustrates this concept is George Orwell's _1984_.

This novel describes life in a dystopian universe, a universe with which the reader is unfamiliar. In the writer's shoes, a possible incipit could be giving a brief description of such a universe, just to get the reader familiar with what you are about to tell.

One might expect the author to begin with a detailed description of this society to set the stage:

> The Party, led by Big Brother, controls a dystopian society under totalitarian rule. Citizens are constantly surveilled, individuality is suppressed, and history is manipulated to ensure absolute power. Thoughtcrime is punishable, and even personal relationships are controlled.

However, Orwell chooses a different approach. The actual opening line is:

> *It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.*

Even though you have yet to be introduced to the Big Brother topic, you sense that something needs to be fixed. Clocks don't strike thirteen. You may not have read about a dystopian world yet, but you start feeling some anomalies.

You might also want to consider Orwell's writing itself. "The clocks were striking thirteen" expresses action and implies that something is happening as you start reading the book. This is distinct from "It was thirteen o'clock."

Gish Jen's Birthmates is my second example.

In this piece, she introduces the word *undivorce* - an invented word that immediately piques your interest.

At first glance, this word leaves you puzzled. Usually, the word divorce has a negative meaning: the end of a relationship. Conversely, the opposite, married, evokes a positive feeling of unity and happiness.

However, *undivorced* sits uneasily in between. It suggests a state where two people are no longer divorced but doesn't quite capture the warmth of reconciliation. Instead, it conveys coldness and tension. With a single word, Jen shows the complexity of the characters' relationship, allowing readers to feel the underlying discomfort without explicitly telling them.

The writer shows all this with a single word.

The final example is Harper Lee's _To Kill a Mockingbird_.

The story is narrated from the perspective of a young girl named Scout. Through her eyes, we see the complexities of her small town. Scout's comments and observations allow us to live inside her mind, experiencing her confusion, curiosity, and growth.

Moreover, Lee masterfully uses the initial chapters to set the stage for the main narrative. Instead of providing a direct exposition of the town's history and social dynamics, she shows us through anecdotes and interactions.

This approach effectively immerses the reader in the setting, thereby making the unfolding events more impactful. Through detailed descriptions spanning over a year, we come to understand the world as Scout does.

## What's The First Step

In _On Writing_, Stephen King offers advice primarily for fiction writers, but many of his techniques can be valuable in non-fiction as well. This chapter will explore how these techniques, when applied, can inspire and enhance both genres.

King's insights on description are particularly impactful. He suggests that effective descriptions focus on specific details, allowing the narrative to expand naturally from there. This is only a small aspect in terms of properly showing, but I believe it's the starting point for a lot of people.

When writing descriptions, he suggests focusing on details and expanding from there. Even if you don't tell all, you tell enough to give the reader context.

This approach is highly applicable to non-fiction. By concentrating on a specific aspect of the topic, writers can make complex or abstract concepts more relatable and tangible for the reader.

If you are talking about how to overcome distraction, tell an example of someone struggling to focus while looking at a laptop screen. Tell what the reader should see. An email notification pops in. You might also write from whom this email is from and what urgent request it is about. Describe the rhythm of the fingers typing over the keyboard and how those are interrupted by a distant chat.

By describing these specific distractions, you allow the reader to visualize the scenario and empathize with the struggle.

Such vivid descriptions not only intrigue the reader but also foster a personal connection. When readers see their experiences reflected in your writing, they're more likely to engage with your text.

In fiction, you can use these elements when you want to give an idea in which a story is set. If you are in a dark cave, you don't have to describe the entire view of the character. You can simply go with some details that let the reader feel you are in a dark place, even a dangerous one. For example, you might focus your attention on some drops falling over a rock or on the bat creaks in the background. You must not tell excessive detailsâ€”like the precise gray shade of a basalt rock at a specific angle. The key is to provide enough detail to spark the reader's imagination, letting them fill in the rest.

Applying this technique, the shopping list piece drastically changes.

As he burst into the grocery store, his lungs burned from running. He paused, hands on knees, catching his breath. From his pocket, he pulled a crumpled yellow Post-it, the ink smudged but legible: bread, milk, mayonnaise (vegan). The hurried scribble mirrored the chaos of his day.

By embracing the 'Show, Don't Tell' paradigm, writers can create more engaging and immersive narratives. Whether in fiction or non-fiction, focusing on vivid details and sensory experiences draws readers into the world you're crafting, making your writing more impactful and memorable."
