# Cognitive Biases

Biases are incorrect mental processes made by our brains. They appear because of evolutionary processes and cultural background.

Many times, they are helpful. If you are in a jungle and animals are attacking you, your first thought is to run away. And guess what? That's the right thing to do. If you spend even a minute trying to think about the best strategies to defeat the animal, it might be too late for you to survive.

This [Wikipedia Quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias#:~:text=A%20cognitive%20bias%20is%20a,their%20behavior%20in%20the%20world.) better expresses this concept:

> Allowing cognitive biases enables faster decisions, which can be desirable when timeliness is more valuable than accuracy, as illustrated inÂ [heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(psychology) "Heuristic (psychology)").

It's essential to recognize that biases, often viewed negatively, have played a significant role in our evolution. Without them, humans might not have survived and thrived as they have.

Cognitive Biases can be split into four different categories.

- [[Too Much Information Cognitive Biases|Filtering Information]]. We tend to notice things we are already familiar with or bizarre and non-homogeneous things.
- [[Not Enough Meaning Cognitive Biases|Find Meaning to the World]]. We tend to follow stereotypes and shared beliefs. Moreover, we tend to believe what we already know is better than what we are unfamiliar with.
- [[Need To Act Fast Cognitive Biases|Quick Reactions]]. We tend to prioritize what is out of our proximity and justify the status quo. Furthermore, you find it difficult to accept you've done something wrong (E.g., Not accepting you've bought something turning out to be a waste of money)
- [[What Should You Remember Cognitive Biases|Deciding what you want to remember]]. We tend to discard specific elements to go general and simplify available information.
