I like to link motivation to the starting phase of your learning.

To tell this from a different perspective, motivation is what pushes you to sit at your desk in the evening after a long day at work and start studying.

There are two different kinds of motivations:

- [[Extrinsic Motivation]]: This is something coming from the outside. The most straightforward example is going to work to get your salary. In this case, your motivation for getting up in the morning and going to work is the payment you get at the end of the month.
- [[Intrinsic Motivation]]: This is when you do something not for external cohesion but because of something coming from the inside. This is what you do because of competition, ambition, or simply [[curiosity]].

When you engage in continuous learning, the most important thing you should rely on is intrinsic motivation (I guess you saw this coming).

When I think about this concept, I often think of having a clear goal in mind. By this, I mean more than a clear outcome, such as getting a degree or a professional certificate. It could also be something more visionary, such as becoming an expert in a specific research field or being involved in one particular mission.

In the real world, it would mean taking some time (I wouldn't feel confident in giving suggestionsâ€”this looks too personal to me) and pondering what you want to learn.

Why are you doing this? What result would you expect? Is there a definition of success or a final exam? Is this training preparatory for further training?

These are just some of the questions I am currently considering. If you find something that does not align with your objectives, simply let it go or seek something else.
