title: Lifelong Learning with a Full-Time Job
draft: false
---
*Lifelong learning is challenging.*

As I experiment with lifelong learning in my current full-time job, I can't help but contrast it with my past at university or high school. Back then, I had what seemed like an abundance of time, which now feels like a luxury.

Now that I have a full-time job, I regret all the free time I had back then, and I realize how precious it was for learning.

With eight hours of my day occupied by my full-time job, there is not much free time for me to sit and learn.

I came here to find the essential points that I need to ponder on to maximize the amount of work I can do right now (I will add further notes on them). Those are the three I found.

- [[Motivation]]
- [[Method]]
- [[Discipline]]

As I am writing, I also came up with a fourth item worth considering: that's [[closure]]. There is a clear analogy with the Closure Phase in Project Management (it's from there that I took the idea).

That might sound obvious, but that's the subtle art of defining an activity closed.

Remember the following text:

I don't mean that you must be able to finish everything you start. Recognizing that you've started something that won't lead anywhere is also a valid way to bring closure.

The key is to find a way to communicate to yourself that you have completed it clearly.
