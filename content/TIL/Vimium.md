I found an exciting tool today that helped me navigate the web without leaving the keyboard to engage with my mouse.

Let's start with a tool that you probably use when surfing the web: Google.

It's a common scenario, isn't it? You're searching for something, and then you have to switch from your keyboard to your mouse to click on the result you want.

Today, I installed `Vimium`. This is an excellent tool for using VIM-like functionality in your browser. You can install it through the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en).

Thanks to this tool, you can navigate every webpage using `j` and `k`. If you are familiar with `Vim`, you know what I am talking about.

The significant upgrade comes now.

When I want to click on a link, I just need to press `f`. After I do this, a lot of letters appear on the screen. Now, you only have to click the letters near the link (or button) you are interested in to open it.
