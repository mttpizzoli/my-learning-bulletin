### Greetings!

Welcome to my corner of the web! I don't know how you did it, but I'm glad you've found your way here.

I'd like to avoid calling this a blog, as I don't have a specific theme to address. It's more about publishing whatever comes to my mind. I'm excited to explore tons of topics here. It *could be about anything*, from reflections on what I read to notes from my daily learning.

Now that you are here, let me share a bit about what you can find.

### What can you find here?

I started this new project in April 2024. You will see there are only a few posts here, but I hope this will be well-filled some months from now.

Each day, an endless curiosity and a passionate interest in knowledge motivate me.

This passion is the main reason why the first (and only - at least for now) section is my [[Today I Learned]] log (shortened in **[[TIL]]**). I ~~copied~~ took inspiration from [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). He did a fantastic job in his GitHub, and I hope my work will be as good in the future.

### What you might expect from me?

This project is still taking root. I have many ideas to write about but need more time to explore them properly. I promise you'll see something more.
