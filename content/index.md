## Greetings!

Welcome to my corner of the web! I don't know how you did it, but I'm glad you've found your way here.

I'd like to avoid calling this a blog, as I don't have a specific theme to address. It's more about publishing whatever comes to my mind. I'm excited to explore tons of topics here. It *could be about anything*, from reflections on what I read to notes from my daily learning.

[[Today I Learned]] - This is a collection of short thoughts on what I learn each day!

[[Books and Quotes]] - This is a series of thoughts and reflections on books that I read.
